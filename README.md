# **Hotel-Revenue-Optimization**
- Project- Optimizing Revenue Leakages in the Hospitality Sector

# Problem Statement

Hotels often lose revenue due to cancellations, no-shows, long lead times, low ADR bookings, and over-dependence on OTA and travel agents. This project explores these leakage points through EDA analysis.

# Objective

This project analyzes hotel performance to uncover revenue leakage by identifying cancellations, inefficiencies, and loss patterns. Using simulated hospitality datasets, it explores key KPIs like Revenue, ADR, RevPAR, Occupancy %, and WoW trends, supported by an interactive Power BI dashboard.

# The Dataset

The project contain **5 datasets**, simulating a real hotel database:
- `fact_bookings.csv`: Booking dates, stay duration, room types
- `dim_hotel.csv`:about hotels (ID, location, type, etc.)
- `dim_rooms.csv`: Room information (room type, size, category)
- `dim_date.csv`: Cancellation reasons and amounts lost
- `fact_aggregated_booking.csv`: Daily room and non-room revenue

# Tools

- **Python** – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** – EDA and visualization
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and KPI tracking
