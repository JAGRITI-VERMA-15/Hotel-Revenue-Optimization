# Hotel-Revenue-Optimization
- Project-OPTIMIZING REVENUE LEAKAGES IN THE HOSPITALITY SECTOR
- Tools-Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib),Jupyter Notebook,Power BI

This project aims to analyze hotel revenue performance and uncover areas of **revenue leakage** using detailed data-driven techniques. It simulates real-world datasets from the hospitality sector to identify operational inefficiencies, cancellations, and loss-generating patterns. A Power BI dashboard was developed to visually communicate these insights.

**Problem Statement**:

Hotels often lose revenue due to cancellations, no-shows, long lead times, low ADR bookings, and over-dependence on OTA and travel agents. This project explores these leakage points through EDA analysis.

**Dataset**:

The project contain **5 datasets**, simulating a real hotel database:
- `bookings.csv`: Booking dates, stay duration, room types
- `guests.csv`: Customer info and segmentation
- `agents.csv`: Booking agents, source, type
- `cancellations.csv`: Cancellation reasons and amounts lost
- `daily_revenue.csv`: Daily room and non-room revenue
