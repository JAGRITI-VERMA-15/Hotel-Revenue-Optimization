#  Project Objective

This project analyzes hotel performance to uncover revenue leakage by identifying cancellations, inefficiencies, and loss patterns. Using simulated hospitality datasets, it explores key KPIs like Revenue, ADR, RevPAR, Occupancy %, and WoW trends, supported by an interactive Power BI dashboard.


# Project Overview :

We collaboratively analyzed simulated hotel data to track key metrics and uncover hidden revenue leakage. 

Here is a brief overview that we did -
- we performed EDA to identify trends across time, booking channels, and room categories.
- Then, we do Feature engineering and calculation of important KPIs such as ADR, RevPAR, Occupancy %, and Week-over-Week changes
- find out reason of revenue leakage that mainly include cancellations and under use services.
- Creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights dynamically and support data-driven decisions

# Dataset

The project contain **5 datasets**, simulating a real hotel database:
- `fact_bookings.csv`: Booking dates, stay duration, room types
- `dim_hotel.csv`:about hotels (ID, location, type, etc.)
- `dim_rooms.csv`: Room information (room type, size, category)
- `dim_date.csv`: Cancellation reasons and amounts lost
- `fact_aggregated_booking.csv`: Daily room and non-room revenue

# Tools

- **Python** – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn** – EDA and visualization
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and KPI tracking
